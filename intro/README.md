## What is a Data Structure?
The amount of resources (time and space) that a computer has is limited. We can always add more resources to a computer but we also want to maximize our profit. So to get maximum performance out of these limited resources we use different techniques a.k.a **data structures** that organize data in such a way that it can be used effectively.

## Some basic Data Structures
- Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary Tree
	- Binary Search Tree
- Heap
- Hashing
- Graph

## Data Types

### Primitive
These are basic data types and are used to store a single value. <br />
Examples are: integer, character, string.

### Non-Primitive
These are derived from primitive data types and are used to store a group of values. <br />
Examples are: array, linked list, stack.

## Types of Data Structures

### Linear
It is a single-level data structure where elements are stored sequentially i.e one after the other. Traversal is done one after the other and all elements can be traversed in a single run. <br />
Examples: array, linked-list, stack, queue

### Non-Linear
It is a multi-level data structure where elements are not stored sequentially, instead, there exists some relationship between the attached elements. In other words elements are arranged in a sorted order. Complete traversal is not possible in one go. <br />
Examples: tree, graph
